# Workflow for serving app locally & running Meticulous tests against it

name: Meticulous

# Important: The workflow needs to run both on pushes to your main branch and on pull requests.
# It needs to run on your main branch because it'll use the results from the
# base commit of the PR on the main branch to compare against.

  # against if an existing workflow hasn't run
